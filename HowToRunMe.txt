pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install langchain
pip install tabulate
pip install yfinance
pip install statsmodels
pip install -U chainlit

# assume you are in the cloned TaskWeaver folder
clear ; python -m taskweaver -p ./project/

best way to run is: 
first uninstall if you have a newer version as it will have errors:
pip uninstall chainlit -y
then install
chainlit run app.py --port 8500


or Using UI:

Install the chainlit package by pip install -U "chainlit<1.1.300" if you don't have it in your environment.
you can do:
pip install -U "chainlit<1.1.300"


# assume you are in the TaskWeaver folder
cd playground/UI/
# make sure you are in playground/UI/ folder
chainlit run app.py --port 8500
